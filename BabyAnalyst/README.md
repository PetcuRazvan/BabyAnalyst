  -Press the corresponding button to calculate each statistical measure.
  -The file must follow one of the two formats shown below:
    
[IntervalSeries.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/23015544/IntervalSeries.txt)
[DistributionSeries.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/23015549/DistributionSeries.txt)

For the Distribution Series:
  The first column represents the number of observations (frequency).
  The second column represents the data values.

For the Interval Series:
  The first column represents the frequency.
  The next two columns represent the class intervals.
